# arithmetic operators

# a and b are operands

a = 5
b = 2
sum = a+b
print(sum)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a%b)
print(a//b)
print(a**b)

# assignment operators

x = 5
x+= 4
print(x)



# comparison operators

x = 5
y = 6
print(x==y)
print(x<y)
print(x>y)
print(x<=y)
print(x>=y)
print(x!=y)

# logical operators

A= x<y and y!=x
print(A)
A= x<y or y!=x
print(A)

B= (not(x<y or x>y))
print(B)
# concatenation
x = " python "
y = " is "
z = " awesome "
print(x+y+z)
